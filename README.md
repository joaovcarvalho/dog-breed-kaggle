# Dog Breed Classification Challenge

This is a challenge from Kanggle to create an algorithm to classify 
dog pictures in their equivalent breeds.

To train the model you have to download the dataset from Kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/c/dog-breed-identification/data

Just unzip the files in the project folder.

Requirements: keras, cv2, pandas, numpy, tqdm
For running the keras model you need TensorFlow or Theano.
